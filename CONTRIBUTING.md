Or create one if you have found a bug or have a feature request.

## Step 2: Fork the Project üç¥

Click the "Fork" button on the main page of the repository to make a copy in your own account.

## Step 3: Clone the repositry and create a Branch üåø

Clone repositry:

```bash
git clone <forked_repositry_name>
```

```bash
git switch -c <your_branch_name>
```

## Step 4: Telegram set-up

- Add your bot to the channel and give it admin rights
- Copy _.env.example_ and change name to _.env_, you can do like this: `cp .env.example .env`

## Step 5: Project set-up

- [Docker set-up](#docker)
- [Local set-up](#local)

### Docker

Docker's installation guide you can find [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Docker Compose installation guide you can find [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

If Docker is installed and running execute the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Local

#### Install dependencies

Dependencies:

- python
- pip
- git
- poetry

You can check if everything installed by this command:

```bash
poetry -v && git -v && pip -v && python --version
```

#### Set-up python virtual environment

Create a virtual environment with poetry
For more information see: (https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/)

You can run do it like this in terminal:

```bash
poetry install && poetry shell
```

If you're using **PyCharm** or **Visual Studio Code** with the Python extension, it should use the virtual environment created by Poetry by default.

#### Problem with redis

If you don't have a redis running on you local machine you can download it and setup appropiate env variables in your _.env_ file.

If you don't want to install reddis for your local dev setup, just add `MEMORY_STORAGE=""` to the .env file.

## Step 6: Work on the Task üë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª

Make the necessary changes in the code or documentation.

## Step 7: Test your code

Make sure that the changes you've made work locally before creating a Pull Request

‚ùï **IMPORTANT**. Make sure to refactor your code using "Black" formatter before creating a Pull Request

To install Black formatter run:

```bash
pip install black
```

To format your code run:

```bash
black .
```

## Step 8: Commit ‚úÖ

Add your changes through Git and create a commit with a descriptive message.

```bash
git add .
```

Create a Commit

```bash
git commit -m 'Your descriptive message'
```

NOTE: Each pull request (PR) should contain only one commit. If you have multiple commits, they need to be squashed.

## Step 9: Work Remotely üåç

When your work is ready and complies with project conventions, upload your changes to your fork:

```bash
# Push your work to your remote repository
git push -u origin <your_branch_name>
```

## Step 10: Create a Pull Request ‚û°Ô∏è

Go to the page of your fork on GitHub and click "New Pull Request". Verify that the changes are displayed correctly, and then submit your pull request.
